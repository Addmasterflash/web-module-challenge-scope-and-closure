/*Task 1: counterMaker()
  
  Study the code for counter1 and counter2, then answer the questions below.
  
  1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2?
  
  //Well, first and foremost counter1 logs the function counter(). Like, the code for counter() not anything else. Counter2
  //logs 0. unless you copy and paste it over and over, then it will increase in increments.
  //im probably running counter1 wrong though.

  2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell?
  
  // counter2 uses a closure because the variable count is globally scoped and it reaches out to grab count.

  3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would 
     counter2 be better?
     
     //at a basic level, counter2 is better for when you need to increase a variable that has global scope, either for all code, or just for a simple part
     //im not explaining this very well but counter2 has closure and it reaches to the global scope for its variable. 
     //counter1 makes changes within its own scope and is probably a lot more preferable in situations where
     //counter is an already taken variable out in the global scope and needs to be changed within the function of counterMaker
     //and counterMaker alone. 

*/
